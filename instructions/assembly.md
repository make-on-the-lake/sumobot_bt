##Assembly

###Chassis

This will take time to dry, so start here. Assemble the chassis parts like so:
<img>

Note that there is a finished and unfinished side to the wood. The sides will have the finished side facing out. The top and bottom will have the finished side facing up, and the plow will have the finished side facing forward.

The top and bottom have arrows which should both be pointing towards the plow:
<img>

Place wood glue where the sides meet once assembled. Hold the parts together with two rubber bands, like so:
<img>

Be careful not to get wood glue on the bands as you'll use them for tires later.
This will take about 30 mintues to dry, or until clear. Set aside for later.

###Electronics

Plug the prototyping shield into the Arduino like so:
<img>

Take care not to force the shield. Ensure that the shield is oriented properly.

The breadboard can sit inside the shield:
<img>

The breadboard has an adhesive backing. I recommend leaving this on and using tape or other non-permanent methods to attach the breadboard to the shield.

**A Note About Breadboards:**
Breadboards internally are electrically connected like this:
<img>
So plugging things in the same column is the same as connecting them with a wire.

This is a diagram of how the breadboard should be wired:

###Servo Horns

Prepare the servo horns. You have a couple but by default the wheels are cut for these:
<img>

Orient the servo horn so that it is on the *unfinished* side of the wheel with the mounting hole facing out:
<img>

**IMPORTANT**
Before attaching horn to wheel, place the servo mounting screw through the horn. It will be "trapped" in by the wheel once attached.
<img>

From the finished side of the wheel, screw through the wheel into the servo horn. Some force may be required as the screws are larger than the holes in the horns.

**IMPORTANT**
If you are unsure at all about your wiring, don't plug in the batteries. Find an organizer and we will help double-check the wiring before connecting power.

###Chassis (Continued)

Once the wood glue is dry, remove the rubber bands.

Screw the ball caster onto the bottom of the chassis:
<img>

Place the ball bearing in the ball caster:
<img>

Your servo comes with rubber isolators that slip over the screw holes. **These are important** as they make enough clearance for the 9v battery. Place them on your servo:
<img>

Mount the servos in the sides, ensuring that the servo wires are facing towards the back of the chassis. Screw the servos in:
<img>

Now that the servos are mounted, attach the wheels. Place a screwdriver through the middle hole of the wheel and turn the captive servo mounting screw into the servo. Take care not to over tighten.
